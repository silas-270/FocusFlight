# Architecture

How the app is put together: what it is for, how its layers depend on each other, where state
lives, and how the native engine is built into it.

## What Blocktime is

A focus timer shaped like a flight. The pilot books a real scheduled route between two real
airports, and the flight's scheduled duration *is* the study session. While the timer runs, a
native 3D globe renders the aircraft flying that route. On landing the flight goes into a
logbook, the pilot's position moves to the destination, and everything derived from that
history (visited countries, achievements, challenge progress) follows.

Two properties shape most of the decisions described in these documents.

**It is a study tool first and a game second.** Every mechanic is measured against how much
friction it puts in front of starting a session. The one-tap path from the Hub to a running
timer is deliberately kept short: in Flight Search, tapping the centred route card books it
directly, and the Hub globe itself is a booking button.

**Everything real-world stays real-world.** The bundled database holds real scheduled routes
between real airports, and there are no invented ones. Because position only moves by flying,
getting across the world means finding a real path across it, which is the game. The authored
itineraries in `PredefinedRouteCatalog` obey the same rule: every leg is a route that exists in
`flights.db`, and `PredefinedRouteCatalogTest` checks each one leg by leg against the database
(see [challenges.md](challenges.md)).

The app is single-player, with no account, no sync and no server. The network is used only for
live-globe map tiles and one optional destination photo per flight, and the app is fully usable
without it ([network.md](network.md)).

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| UI | Jetpack Compose, Material 3, Navigation Compose |
| Presentation | One ViewModel per screen exposing `StateFlow`s, each built by a hand-written `ViewModelProvider.Factory` |
| Persistence | Room (`user_data.db`), a bundled read-only SQLite asset (`flights.db`), `SharedPreferences` |
| 3D engine | CesiumRS, a Rust/wgpu globe renderer built into `libcesium_rs.so` |
| Native bridges | JNI for the live engine, JNA for offscreen renders |
| Host activity | `GameActivity` from androidx.games |
| Build | Gradle Kotlin DSL, KSP for Room, `cargo-ndk` for the Rust library |

`minSdk` 26, `targetSdk` 36, `compileSdk` 37. Only `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` are built, the two
ABIs the native library is compiled for ([engine.md](engine.md)).

```

Dependencies point downward. The pure parts of `data/model` (`ChallengeProgress`,
`AchievementProgress`, `Tour`, `HomeBaseCooldown`, `PredefinedRoute`) and most of `domain/`
(`RouteNetwork`, `AirportSearchIndex`, `EnginePowerModel`) carry no Android, Room or JNI
dependency, which is what lets them run as plain JVM unit tests.

**Repositories are interfaces with a single `Local*` implementation.** The interface is not a
placeholder for a remote backend; it is the seam that lets a JVM test substitute a fake without
Room or the NDK. The same reasoning pulled several pieces of logic out of ViewModels into
standalone functions: `InFlightViewModel` loads the native library the moment it touches
`CesiumLiveJniBridge`, so it cannot be instantiated in a unit test, and anything that needs
testing is moved out of it. That is where `processLandingForChallenges`,
`resolveLandingOutcome`, `loadRouteContext` and `resolveNextLeg` come from, and why the
landing's concurrency guarantee lives in `SessionPausedFlightStore` rather than in a flag on
the ViewModel ([state.md](state.md#concurrent-writers)).

## The composition root

There is no dependency-injection framework. `CesiumGameActivity.onCreate()` constructs every
repository once and hands them to screens through the ViewModel factories. The graph is small
enough to read in one screen, and the order in which it is built carries meaning:

1. The `flights.db` data source and airport repository, the `PendingFlightLoader`, the
   preferences repository, and the process-wide `OfflineModeController`.
2. The Room database and the user, flight-log, challenge and achievement repositories.
3. `PilotProgressRepository`, on an `appScope` that outlives every ViewModel, so the shared
   derivation of the pilot's progress stays warm across navigation
   ([achievements.md](achievements.md#the-shared-derivation)).
4. `ensureDatabaseCopied()`, which refreshes the bundled database if the app was installed or
   updated since the last copy ([flight-data.md](flight-data.md#copying-and-opening-it)).
5. `CesiumEngineManager`, attached to the Activity lifecycle before any Compose content exists.
6. Two background jobs: one keeps the home base's globe render pinned in the image cache
   ([maps.md](maps.md#the-cache)); the other parses the world-map SVG ahead of the first screen
   that draws it.
7. A startup self-heal: if `onboarding_completed` is set but no profile row exists, the flag is
   reset, so the start destination is Onboarding rather than a Hub whose repositories would all
   throw on `requireProfileId()`.

Two Activity-scoped channels, `LandingResultChannel` and `DestinationPhotoChannel`, are built as
plain fields. They carry per-landing results to screens that exist after `InFlightViewModel` has
been destroyed ([navigation.md](navigation.md#what-travels-outside-the-route)).

## The two databases

They are unrelated and have opposite lifecycles.

**`flights.db`** is reference data: 4,170 airports, 57,570 routes and 5,670 runways, bundled in
`assets/`, copied into the app's databases directory and opened read-only. Nothing in the app
writes it, which is what makes the several process-lifetime caches on top of it safe. Its
provenance, contents and quirks are in [flight-data.md](flight-data.md).

**`user_data.db`** is the pilot's own data: a Room database at schema version 10 with four
entities, `user_profile`, `flight_log`, `challenges` and `achievement_unlocks`. Migrations from
version 6 onward are explicit `Migration` objects in `AppDatabase.kt`, each validated by the
instrumented `MigrationTest` against the schema JSON exported to `app/schemas/`. Versions 1 to 5
predate the exported schemas and are listed in `fallbackToDestructiveMigrationFrom`, so only
those are ever rebuilt from scratch; any other schema change without a migration fails at launch
rather than silently deleting the logbook ([state.md](state.md#migrations)).

A third store, `SharedPreferences` (`blocktime_prefs`), holds short-lived, fast-changing values
such as the pilot's current airport and the Story and Free paused-flight slots. Which value lives
where, and why, is the subject of [state.md](state.md).

## Assets

| Asset | Used by |
|---|---|
| `flights.db` | `AirportRouteSqliteDataSource`, see [flight-data.md](flight-data.md) |
| `world-map.svg` | `WorldMapParser` and `InteractiveWorldMap`, see [maps.md](maps.md#the-2d-world-map) |
| `Boeing787Cockpit.glb` | CesiumRS, cockpit camera mode |

The offline vector world map that the engine rasterises is compiled into `libcesium_rs.so`
itself, not shipped as an asset.

## Debug-only code

Debug tooling lives in the `app/src/debug/` source set and is never compiled into a release
build. Where main code has to call into it, `app/src/release/` provides a same-signature
stand-in that does nothing. The In-Flight `FlightDebugMenu` is the main example: a collapsed
"DBG" chip that opens seek, flight speed (0.1× to 500×), pause/resume and skip-to-landing. The
ViewModel hooks it drives (`debugSeek`, `setDebugTimeScale`, `skipFlight`) are in main code, but
nothing in a release build calls them, so release flights always run at real time.

The debug manifest also registers two broadcast receivers: `PerfScenarioReceiver`, which tags a
Perfetto capture for `tools/run_perf_scenario.sh`, and `DebugSeedReceiver`, which inserts a set
of demonstration flights. `CesiumGameActivity` registers a debug-only receiver for navigation and
screen capture, used by `tools/capture_all_screens.sh`.

## Build

```
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug        # preBuild runs cargoNdkBuild first
./gradlew test                      # JVM unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest      # instrumented: MigrationTest, PredefinedRouteCatalogTest
```

`preBuild` depends on `cargoNdkBuild`, which cross-compiles CesiumRS with `cargo ndk` for both
ABIs and copies each `libcesium_rs.so` into `src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/`. The environment it needs
and the profiling variant are described in [engine.md](engine.md#building-the-native-library).

Machine-local configuration lives in the untracked `local.properties`: SDK paths, the optional
`PEXELS_API_KEY` (compiled into `BuildConfig`), `CARTO_API_KEY` and `ESRI_API_KEY` (passed to the
Rust build as environment variables), and the four `RELEASE_*` signing properties. Without all
four signing properties the release build is produced unsigned.

## Testing

JVM unit tests cover the pure layers and the seams extracted for them: progress math, tour
segmentation, cooldowns, achievement evaluation and stacking, route-network and search logic,
airport clocks, the world-map projection, offline-mode resolution, the render cache and route
selection, the landing outcome diff, challenge crediting, and the two audio classes.

A few of them test a property rather than a function, and are worth knowing about:

- `ChallengeRowConcurrentWriteTest` reproduces the concurrent writes to a challenge row that a
  landing and an in-flight save can produce. Its fake DAO models Room's real write granularity
  (a whole-row `@Update` rewrites every column, a scoped `UPDATE` does not), so it cannot pass
  against a DAO that could not exist ([state.md](state.md#concurrent-writers)).
- `PilotProgressRepositoryTest` pins that a failed derivation keeps the previous snapshot and that
  a username edit does not trigger a recompute.
- `EngineSoundSynthTest` renders the synthesised audio and measures it, so "does this still sound
  like a jet" is a spectral check rather than a listening session
  ([engine-sound.md](engine-sound.md#testing)).
- `MigrationTest` (instrumented) runs every migration against its exported schema. The build adds
  `app/schemas` to the androidTest assets, because `MigrationTestHelper` loads the old schema from
  there at runtime.
- `PredefinedRouteCatalogTest` (instrumented) checks every authored itinerary against the real
  `flights.db`.
