# R8 rules for the release build. The JNI bridge (CesiumLiveJniBridge's `external fun`s) needs
# nothing here: the default proguard-android-optimize.txt keeps native method names, and the
# Rust side never calls back into Java by name.

# JNA (engine/headless/CesiumHeadlessJnaBindings.kt) reflects on everything it touches: the
# Library interface becomes a runtime proxy, and Structure fields are looked up by the names in
# @FieldOrder. JNA's own classes are also looked up from its native dispatch code.
